  <p id=p2> Robert Englund was auditioning for a role in Apocalypse Now when he walked across the hall where auditions were taking place for George Lucas's Star Wars. After watching the auditions for a while, he realized that Hamill, his friend, would be perfect for the role of Luke Skywalker.[14] He suggested to Hamill that he audition for the role;[16] as it turned out, Hamill's agent had already set up the audition that gave him the role.[17]

Released in May 1977, Star Wars was an enormous, unexpected success and had a huge effect on the film industry. Hamill also appeared in the less-than-successful Star Wars Holiday Special in 1978[18] and later starred in the successful sequels The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. During the time between the first two films, Hamill was involved in a serious automobile accident, fracturing his nose and left cheekbone.[14] False rumors spread that he required plastic surgery on his face.[19] For both of the sequels, Hamill was honored with the Saturn Award for Best Actor given by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films.

Hamill reprised the role of Luke Skywalker for the radio dramatizations of both Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back.[20] For the Return of the Jedi radio drama, the role was played by a different actor.[21]

Editions of Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces (which influenced Lucas as he was developing the films) issued after the release of Star Wars in 1977 used the image of Hamill as Luke Skywalker on the cover.[22][23]

Hamill returned to the Star Wars universe in 2014, when he voiced the ancient Sith Lord Darth Bane,[24] in the last episode of season 6 of the animated series The Clone Wars. He was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for his performance.[25]


Mark Hamill in 2017, at the premiere of The Last Jedi.
With the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, a Disney press release was announced that there would be more Star Wars films starting with The Force Awakens, which was released on December 18, 2015. Initially, both Disney and Hamill were coy about whether Hamill would be a cast member of The Force Awakens.[26][27] It was reported that Hamill had been assigned a nutritionist and personal trainer to work with ahead of production. In September 2013, Hamill's friend Robert Englund confirmed that "they've got Mark in the gym because Mark's coming back as Luke Skywalker."[28] Despite having top billing, Hamill only appears briefly at the end of the film (with no dialogue) in a cliffhanger set-up for the sequel.[29][30][31]

Hamill played Skywalker again in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, released on December 15, 2017.[32] Hamill was initially critical of his own role in the film, stating that he and director Rian Johnson had "a fundamental difference" on Skywalker's characterization.[33][34][35] Hamill later expressed regret for having made those statements, calling the film an "all-time great",[36] and reprised his role as Skywalker again in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.[37]

Hamill also has a brief vocal cameo in The Last Jedi as a droid[38] as well as in Rogue One and Solo: A Star Wars Story in undisclosed roles, for which he was credited as "William M. Patrick" and "Patrick Williams".[39]

Hamill was digitally de-aged to reprise his role as Luke Skywalker in the Season 2 finale of The Mandalorian. [40] <p>
